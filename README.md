# SentAlign

SentAlign is a sentence alignment tool for parallel corpora. It uses [LaBSE](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.62.pdf) embeddings to find sentence pairs that are similar in meaning 
and an alignment algorithm based on Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal alignment. Dynamic programming with cosine similarity tends to favour many-to-many alignments over 1-1 alignments. To counteract this we end with re-evaluating each alignment by inspecting mergers, insertions and deletions. The approach is described in more detail in the paper [SentAlign: Accurate and Scalable Sentence Alignment]().

### Building the environment

If you haven't already check out the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/steinst/SentAlign.git
cd SentAlign
```

The environment can be built using the provided environment.yml file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Running the aligner
We assume that the documents to be aligned have the same names in the source and target language, but are kept in folders named using the language code. For example, if we want to align the files in the folder `/path/to/files` we would have the following structure:
```bash
/path/to/files/eng/file1.txt
/path/to/files/eng/file2.txt
...
/path/to/files/isl/file1.txt
/path/to/files/isl/file2.txt
```

Assuming a Conda environment has been built as described above, the environment has to be activated before SentAlign is run:
```bash
conda activate SentAlign
```

Start by creating a list of files to align:

```bash
python3 files2align.py -dir /path/to/files --source-language eng
```

Then you run the alignments. Aligning English and Icelandic files:

```bash
python3 sentAlign.py -dir /path/to/files -sl eng -tl isl
```

The aligner generates two type of files in the output folder: `/path/to/files/output`. Files ending with `.path` files containing the alignments and LaBSE scores. They are formatted like this:

```
[0]:[0,1]:0.7565563
[1]:[2]:0.99999994
[2]:[3]:0.92132425
[3]:[4]:0.87890404
[4]:[5,6]:0.9721296
[]:[7]:0
[5]:[8]:0.89229476
[6]:[9]:0.70389956
...
```

and `.aligned` files containing the aligned sentence pairs as well as the LaBSE score. Source sentence in the first column, target sentence in the second and LaBSE score in the third:



## Evaluating Test Sets
The SentAlign paper evaluates the aligner on two evaluation sets: the German-French evaluation set comprising data from the text+berg corpus and published with BleuAlign, and an Icelandic-English test set using data from the Parice corpus. 

To reproduce the results, run the following commands for the German-French test set:

```bash
python3 files2align.py -dir eval_data/bleualign --source-language deu
python3 sentAlign.py -dir eval_data/bleualign -sl deu -tl fra
python3 evaluation/evaluate.py -t eval_data/bleualign/output/test*.txt.path -g eval_data/bleualign/gold/test*.txt
```
Which should give you the following results:
```
 ---------------------------------
|             |  Strict |    Lax  |
| Precision   |   0.935 |   0.998 |
| Recall      |   0.929 |   0.933 |
| F1          |   0.932 |   0.964 |
 ---------------------------------
```
